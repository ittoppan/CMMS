# @xds/theme-neutral

# 0.2.0

#### Fixes

- Neutral theme: express the light `--color-border` as `#00000014` (translucent black) instead of the opaque `#ebebeb`. Same rendered color over a white surface, but it now blends over any background — matching the translucent dark-mode value.

# 0.1.7

#### Fixes

- StatusDot now uses the same vivid fills as the filled Badge in the neutral theme. Previously the dots mapped to the dark text/icon stops (dark green, maroon, brown), which read muddy in light mode; success/warning/error/accent now match their badge counterparts so a dot and its badge share one status color.
