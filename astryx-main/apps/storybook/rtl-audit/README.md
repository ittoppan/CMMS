# RTL semantic audit

A Playwright-driven audit that grades component stories against the astryx RTL
contract. It renders each target story **twice in the same run** — once LTR,
once RTL (via Storybook's `globals=direction:rtl` toggle) — and asserts the
_relationship_ between the two renders. There are **no golden/baseline
screenshots**: nothing is committed to git, nothing drifts on OS/font
differences. It reuses the `@playwright/test` chromium the `pr-a11y` job already
installs and mirrors that job's build-storybook → serve → drive shape. In CI it
is the `pr-rtl` job — the RTL sibling of `pr-a11y`.

## Two layers

### A. Auto-discovery — over EVERY `core-*` story

The point of the audit is to auto-catch **new or changed** components, so the
auto-discovery layer runs across the whole library with **zero curated
selectors**. There are two independent auto passes: **D1 (icon-mirror)** and
**D5 (positional-mirror)**.

### A.1 D1 icon-mirror

Directional-icon mirroring. For each core story it:

1. Loads the story LTR and RTL.
2. Finds **directional** icons generically — classifying each icon SVG as
   left/right via (a) lucide class names (`lucide-chevron-left`,
   `lucide-arrow-right`, `lucide-chevrons-left`, `lucide-caret-right`,
   `lucide-move-left`, …), (b) known fallback-registry path signatures
   (chevron-left `m15 18-6-6 6-6`, chevron-right `m9 18 6-6-6-6`), and (c) the
   enclosing button's aria-label context. **Vertical glyphs (up/down chevrons,
   vertical carets) are excluded**, and ambiguous glyphs are treated as
   non-directional (err toward _not_ flagging — fewer false positives during the
   soft-gate window).
3. Pairs each directional icon LTR↔RTL by aria-context (fallback: index) and
   grades:
   - **pass** — every directional icon is handled: either the wrapper's computed
     `transform` becomes a horizontal-flip matrix (`matrix(-1,0,0,1,…)`) under
     RTL while identity under LTR (the shared `rtlStyles.mirror` `scaleX(-1)`),
     **or** the rendered glyph direction swaps left↔right (name-swap, e.g.
     Pagination's `chevronLeft`↔`chevronRight`).
   - **not-RTL (fail)** — a directional glyph is present but neither flips nor
     swaps (shipped without RTL handling), or it double-flips (flip in _both_
     directions nets to no mirror).
   - **N-A** — the story has no directional icons (not penalised).

This is the broad safety net: a component that lands a directional chevron
without RTL support shows up as a not-RTL finding automatically.

#### Interaction-revealed icons (popovers, dialogs, menus)

Many directional icons live inside content that is closed by default — e.g. the
`Calendar` nav chevrons inside a `DateInput`/`DateRangeInput`/`DateTimeInput`
popover. In the closed story those chevrons are mounted but 0×0, so their mirror
transform can't be evaluated. To avoid a false not-RTL, auto-discovery first runs
a **defensive reveal step**: before scanning, it clicks the first collapsed
disclosure trigger (`aria-haspopup` / `aria-expanded="false"` / `role=combobox`)
and waits briefly for popover/dialog/menu/`[popover]` content to appear, then
scans the opened DOM. Every action is time-boxed and swallowed, so the ~vast
majority of stories with no disclosure surface are untouched and never hang. As a
second guard, any icon still rendered at 0×0 after the reveal (genuinely
unreachable) is **not** counted as a directional finding — it contributes to
N-A, never a false not-RTL. Net effect: the Date\*Inputs correctly score **pass**
because their embedded Calendar chevrons mirror once the popover is open.

### A.2 D5 positional-mirror

A second auto pass, over **every** core story, that catches a bug class D1 and
the `@astryx/no-physical-properties` **lint both miss**: an element positioned
with a **logical anchor** (`insetInlineStart` / `insetInlineEnd`, which _does_
flip under RTL) paired with an **unflipped physical transform**
(`translate`/`translateX`, which does _not_ flip). The physical translate
over/under-shifts the box relative to its mirrored anchor, so the element lands
on the **wrong side** in RTL.

Real instances found this way (all logical-anchor + physical-translate): the
Avatar **status-dot**, the Table **sticky-column shadow**, the **ResizeHandle**
hit-area, and the Carousel **pill**.

For each core story it:

1. Loads the story LTR and RTL (reusing the same `settle()` + **reveal step** as
   D1, so interaction-gated positioned elements — dialogs/popovers/menus — are
   scanned too, not just static ones).
2. Auto-discovers candidates: every element whose computed
   `position: absolute|fixed` **and** whose computed `transform` has a non-zero
   horizontal translate component (parsed from the `matrix()` _e_-value /
   `matrix3d` 12th entry). No per-component selectors.
3. Records each candidate's **center-X relative to its `offsetParent`**, then
   pairs LTR↔RTL candidates by DOM index (stable across directions in every
   tested story) and asserts the RTL center **mirrors** the LTR center about the
   parent's horizontal center:

   ```
   rtl_relCenterX  ≈  parentW − ltr_relCenterX      (within tolerance)
   ```

   - **pass** — every positioned candidate mirrors about its parent center.
   - **not-RTL (fail)** — a candidate's RTL center is _not_ the mirror of its
     LTR center: it stayed on the same physical side (or over-shot). The report
     lists the element class + LTR/RTL `relCenterX` + delta as an actionable
     finding.
   - **N-A** — the story has no logical-anchor + physical-transform candidates
     (the common case — not penalised).

**Tolerance: 3px.** The observed signal gap was ~10× the tolerance (a real
mis-position is tens of px off; a correctly-centered element passes at Δ=0 by
construction — e.g. a Slider thumb centered with `translateX(-50%)` mirrors to
itself). 3px absorbs sub-pixel rounding without admitting the bug class.

Three guards keep D5 at **0 false positives** at full-library scale. A real
wrong-side bug is a **small** element (width ≪ parent) sitting at one **edge**;
each guard removes a benign shape that is _not_ that:

**1. Mandatory degenerate-parent guard.** Any candidate whose `offsetParent` is
**< 8px wide** is skipped. A ~1px-wide parent (e.g. the ResizeHandle divider)
makes the mirror target ≈ the element's own coordinate, producing meaningless
"already-mirrored" or "wildly-off" readings — pure noise. In the validation
spike this guard removed the single false positive.

**2. Full-span / origin guard.** Any candidate whose own width is **≥ 90 % of
its parent's width** is skipped: a full-bleed strip spans the _entire_ parent,
so it occupies both halves and has **no left/right side** to land on the wrong
one. This catches `useResizable`'s **vertical** grab zone (`ResizeHandle`'s
`hitAreaOffsetY`): a full-width strip anchored `insetInlineStart:0;
insetInlineEnd:0` with a purely-visual centering `translate(-50%,…)`, so its
geometric _center_ sits at the parent origin (relCenterX≈0) **identically in LTR
and RTL**. The mirror assertion would otherwise compute `expected = parentW − 0
= parentW` and fire a spurious `Δ = parentW`. The degenerate-parent guard misses
it (the parent is ~850–1034 px, not tiny) and the centered guard misses it (the
center is at the _edge_, x≈0, not at `parentW/2`) — so this dedicated guard is
required. A real bug (Avatar status-dot: a tiny dot in a 20–128 px parent) has
`elW ≪ parentW` and is unaffected.

**3. Centered-element guard.** A candidate already at the parent's horizontal
center (within 5 % of parent width) mirrors to itself and can't exhibit the bug;
skipping it removes benign vertical-control noise (e.g. a vertical Slider thumb).

With all three guards the pass is **6/6 true positives (all Avatar status-dot
variants), 0 false positives across the full library**.

**Why lint can't catch this.** `@astryx/no-physical-properties` (and any
per-property linter) sees each declaration in isolation: a _logical_ inset is
_encouraged_, and a `transform` is not a physical _inset_ property, so neither is
flagged. The bug only exists in the **interaction** of the two at layout time,
which is visible only by comparing the rendered LTR vs RTL geometry — exactly
what D5 does.

### B. Curated precision — D2 / D3 / D4

`targets.json` holds the geometry/behavior dimensions that genuinely need
hand-written selectors, run **in addition** to auto-discovery:

- **D2 layout-order-flip** — prev/next controls swap horizontal order
  (`boundingBox`). _(Calendar, Lightbox.)_
- **D3 behavior-flip** — directional behavior inverts, e.g. Carousel's scroll
  axis: "next" makes `scrollLeft` go positive in LTR and negative in RTL.
- **D4 overlay-side** — a positioned affordance flips side (`boundingBox`).

D1 is intentionally **not** in `targets.json` — auto-discovery covers it
universally.

## Why relationship-based, not pixel baselines

Directional RTL bugs are _semantic_ ("the chevron didn't mirror", "prev/next
didn't swap sides", "the scroll axis didn't invert"), not "these pixels
changed". The audit asserts the LTR→RTL relationship per dimension, catching
exactly that class of regression while sidestepping the flakiness of
glyph-over-photo pixel diffing.

## Running locally

```bash
# 1. Build the packages + a static Storybook (root build MUST run first, or the
#    storybook build fails to resolve @astryxdesign/build/dist/vite.mjs).
pnpm build
pnpm -F @astryxdesign/storybook build

# 2. Install the Playwright browser (once).
npx playwright install chromium

# 3. Run the audit against the built Storybook.
pnpm -F @astryxdesign/storybook rtl-audit
#   -> prints the scorecard and writes rtl-audit-report.json

# Scope to one component while iterating (applies to both layers):
node apps/storybook/rtl-audit/rtl-audit.mjs --storybook-dir apps/storybook/dist \
  --output /tmp/report.json --filter Pagination

# Just the broad auto-discovery net, or just the curated dims:
node apps/storybook/rtl-audit/rtl-audit.mjs --storybook-dir apps/storybook/dist --auto-only
node apps/storybook/rtl-audit/rtl-audit.mjs --storybook-dir apps/storybook/dist --curated-only
```

Exit code is non-zero if auto-discovery finds any not-RTL component or a curated
dim fails — but the CI job is soft (see below), so this never hard-blocks.

## Adding a curated target

Edit `targets.json`. Each entry is:

```jsonc
{
  "component": "MyComponent",
  "storyId": "core-mycomponent--some-story", // must exist in dist/index.json
  "dims": ["D2", "D3"], // D2/D3/D4 only (D1 is auto)
  "setup": {"click": "img"}, // optional: reveal the target
  "selectors": {
    "prev": "button[aria-label=\"Prev\"]", // D2
    "next": "button[aria-label=\"Next\"]",
    "scroller": "[aria-roledescription=\"carousel\"] > div:first-child", // D3
    "nextButton": "button[aria-label=\"Scroll right\"]",
    "overlay": "…",
    "overlayRoot": "…", // D4
  },
}
```

## No allowlist — any not-RTL is a failure

The RTL migration is complete: every component's directional icons mirror
correctly, so the audit runs with **no allowlist**. Any component auto-discovery
scores not-RTL is a real regression (a **surprise**) and should be fixed, not
excused. There is deliberately no mechanism to mark a not-RTL component as
"expected" — such a mechanism would be a built-in way to silence a genuine
future regression.

### D5 positional-mirror is not yet clean on `main`

D5 currently flags the Avatar **status-dot** on `main`: it anchors the dot with
a physical `right` + `translate(50%, 50%)`, so under RTL the dot stays
bottom-**right** instead of mirroring to bottom-**left** — a genuine RTL bug.
The fix lives on a separate branch (**#4564**) that hasn't merged yet, so on any
branch cut from `main` D5 will report the Avatar status-dot stories as
positional-mirror FAILs. **This is a real finding, not a false positive**, and
is deliberately **not** suppressed — the soft-gate (see below) keeps it
non-blocking, and it clears automatically once #4564 lands. Every _other_
component passes D5 (0 other flags), matching the validation spike's
6/6-in-Avatar-only result.

## Soft-gated — pending a stability window

The `pr-rtl` CI job runs with `continue-on-error: true`: a finding surfaces the
scorecard in the job summary but does not block merges while the audit is
observed for flake over a stability window. This soft-gate is what lets the
Avatar D5 finding (above) surface honestly without breaking CI. To promote to a
required check once stable: drop `continue-on-error` from the `pr-rtl` job in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and add it to the required checks.
